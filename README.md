- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JimenaRobles what I like most about UX/UI design is that you are constantly connected to users and make an impact on their daily lives by analyzing the various solutions that affect their lives, how they feel and need.
You never get bored, there is always a new challenge to work on and improve on.
And best of all, with a large group of colleagues you can iterate as many times as possible until you get to deliver an excellent product.
